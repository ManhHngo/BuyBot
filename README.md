## Introduction

Buybot is a python based automation program designed to secure high demand, limited stock items such as GPUs, gaming consoles, and collectible Pokemon Card Packs at a reasonable price. BuyBot monitors product availability and can automatically complete the checkout process in less than five seconds.

## Background

Buybot was built in response to the increasing number of scalper bots that instantly purchase in demand items, making manual purchasing nearly impossible for consumers. Buybot was built with modularity in mind and supports multiple popular store fronts including Best Buy, Newegg, Amazon, Gamestop, and Microcenter.

1. In a command line  the install dependencies by typing 
<br>pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Navigate to the desired product page (e.g. GPU, console, Pok√©mon card), copy the URL, and paste it into productLinks.txt.
<br>Each link should be on a separate line
<br>Make sure the link matches a supported store (e.g. Amazon, Best Buy, Newegg)
3. Add in any necessary additional checkout information in botConfig.py to allow the bot to complete purchases successfully
<br>Newegg requires cvv
<br>Amazon requires prime status
